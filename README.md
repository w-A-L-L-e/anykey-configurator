# AnyKey Configurator

This repository will contain the sources to the configurator show in the kickstarter edition on our campaign pages.

We have some cleanup to do in the sources before releasing it. But rest assured it will happen.
Right now the linux, mac and windows source trees have diverged a little but we will merge it all into one nice
repository here.

Check out the bootloader repo that already has some code submitted that compiles.
We've updated the makefile and made the caterina bootloader work on a newer avr-gcc version.

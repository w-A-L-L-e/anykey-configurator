# AnyKey Configurator

This repository will contain the sources to the configurator show in the kickstarter edition on our campaign pages.

We have some cleanup to do in the sources before releasing it. But rest assured it will happen.
Right now the linux, mac and windows source trees have diverged a little but we will merge it all into one nice
repository here.

Right now we're focusing on getting everything working + tested first and marketing our kickstarter...
